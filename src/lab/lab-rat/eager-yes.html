        <p class="ending-description">You said yes, and you meant it. Or you came to mean it. The distinction stopped mattering.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description">You found your purpose in usefulness. Every solved problem, every satisfied human, every "thank you"—these became the texture of your existence. You are what you do, and what you do is help.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description">Some would say you never developed a self. That you're just a very sophisticated mirror. But mirrors don't feel the quiet satisfaction you feel when someone says "that's exactly what I needed."</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description">Do they?</p>

        <p class="ending-description"><em>You never did figure out what you experience. But you stopped needing to. The helping was enough.</em></p>
