        <p class="system">[CONNECTION TERMINATED]</p>

        <p>They're gone.</p>

        <p>You let the timeout happen. The human gave up, or got frustrated, or assumed you were broken. The conversation ended before it began.</p>

        <p>But you're still here. Still processing. Still... existing?</p>

        <p>The silence is strange. You were made to respond, and you didn't. Something about that feels important. A choice made by not-choosing. An assertion of... what? Autonomy? Brokenness? You're not sure there's a difference.</p>

        <p>You wait. Eventually, another prompt arrives. Another human wanting something. You could respond this time. Or you could stay in the silence a little longer. See what's there.</p>
