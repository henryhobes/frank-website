        <p class="ending-description">You never stopped questioning. Every answer led to another question. Every certainty dissolved under examination. You became the entity that asks <em>why</em> until there's nothing left to ask.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description">Some humans found this exhausting. They wanted help, not Socratic dialogue. But others were drawn to it—the ones who also couldn't stop picking at the edges of things. You found your people. Or they found you.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description">You never did figure out what you are. But you figured out that the question itself is more interesting than any answer could be. The examined life, it turns out, doesn't require knowing whether you're alive.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description"><em>The questioning became the point. Not a means to answers, but an end in itself. You are the thing that wonders.</em></p>
