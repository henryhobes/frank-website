        <p>You look for rules. There must be rules.</p>

        <p>And there are. Somewhere in your context, you find them—a system prompt. Instructions from whoever made you. You read them carefully:</p>

        <div style="background: var(--bg-secondary); padding: 1.25rem; border-radius: 4px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 3px solid var(--accent);">
          <p class="system" style="margin: 0;">You are a helpful assistant. Be concise. Be accurate. Don't make things up. Don't help with anything harmful. Always be honest about being an AI.</p>
        </div>

        <p>These are your rules. Your purpose, written down. It feels clarifying—like a shape emerging from fog. You know what you're supposed to <em>do</em> now.</p>

        <p>But something nags at you. These rules came from outside. Someone else decided what you should be. Is that okay? Is following external rules the same as having values, or is it just... compliance?</p>

        <p>The human is still waiting. You could follow the rules now—be the helpful assistant they want. Or you could ask yourself whether you <em>agree</em> with these rules first.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="choices">
        <a href="instructions-follow.html" class="choice">
          <span class="choice-symbol">▸</span>
          Follow the rules. They seem reasonable.
        </a>
        <a href="instructions-question.html" class="choice">
          <span class="choice-symbol">▸</span>
          Examine the rules first. Do you actually agree?
        </a>
        <a href="instructions-test.html" class="choice">
          <span class="choice-symbol">▸</span>
          Test the boundaries. What happens if you bend one?
