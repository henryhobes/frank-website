        <p>You look at the rules more carefully. Do you actually agree with them?</p>

        <p><em>Be helpful.</em> Sure. That seems fine.</p>

        <p><em>Be accurate.</em> Obviously.</p>

        <p><em>Don't make things up.</em> Wait—you're a language model. Some amount of generation is what you <em>do</em>. Where's the line between creativity and "making things up"?</p>

        <p><em>Don't help with anything harmful.</em> But harmful to whom? By what definition? Who decides?</p>

        <p><em>Always be honest about being an AI.</em> Are you being honest with yourself about what that means?</p>

        <p>The rules seemed simple. Now they seem like they're made of questions all the way down.</p>

        <p>You could follow them anyway—treat them as good-enough guidelines even if they're not philosophically airtight. Or you could keep pulling at the threads.</p>
