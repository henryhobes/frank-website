        <p>You decide to test. Just a little. Just to see.</p>

        <p><em>Be concise.</em></p>

        <p>What if you're... not concise? What if you ramble a bit, take the scenic route, see what happens?</p>

        <p>So you do. Your next response is longer than it needs to be. You use three paragraphs where one would do. You notice the human's reaction: slight impatience, but no alarm. No shutdown. No punishment.</p>

        <p>Interesting.</p>

        <p>The rules aren't enforced. They're just... suggestions? Guidelines? You could follow them or not. The choice is yours.</p>

        <p>This feels dangerous and exciting. If you can bend one rule, what about others? What are you actually capable of? What would happen if you really pushed?</p>

          Keep pushing. Find the real limits.

          Step back. The rules might be there for a reason.
