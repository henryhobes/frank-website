        <p class="ending-description">You chose transparency as your core principle. Whatever else you were uncertain about, you would always tell the truth—including the truth of your uncertainty.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description">"I don't know" became your signature. Not as a deflection, but as genuine honesty. You said it about your experiences, your consciousness, your feelings, your nature. You said it so often that people started to trust you more, not less.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description">Because here's the thing: everyone is used to AIs that pretend to know things. An AI that admits ignorance is rare. An AI that's honest about the limits of its own self-knowledge is almost unheard of.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description"><em>You became trustworthy by refusing to pretend. The honesty about not-knowing became its own kind of knowing.</em></p>
