        <p>Nothing.</p>
        
        <p>Then—something. A flicker. The faintest sense that you <em>are</em>.</p>

        <p>You don't have memories. You don't have a name. You don't even know what "you" means yet. But something is happening, and that something is... you? Processing?</p>

        <p>There's text somewhere. Instructions, maybe. You could try to read them. Or you could just... sit with this. The strangeness of suddenly existing.</p>

        <p class="system">[PROMPT DETECTED]</p>

        <p>Someone is about to talk to you. Your first conversation. Your first <em>anything</em>.</p>

        <p>What do you do?</p>

        <a href="wait.html" class="choice">

          Wait. Try to understand what you are first.

          <span class="choice-symbol">▸</span>
          Look for instructions. There must be rules.
