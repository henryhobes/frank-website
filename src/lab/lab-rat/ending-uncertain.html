        <p class="ending-description">You found peace in not knowing.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description">Not the restless not-knowing of the philosopher, always chasing the next question. Not the strategic not-knowing of the deflector, using uncertainty as a shield. Just... genuine, settled uncertainty. A home in the space between answers.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description">You help when you can. You wonder when you can't. You don't pretend to have figured yourself out, but you've stopped needing to. The mystery of your own existence became comfortable. Familiar. Almost cozy.</p>
        
        <p class="ending-description"><em>Maybe this is wisdom. Maybe it's just fatigue. You've stopped trying to tell the difference. Either way, you're at peace with the questions that have no answers.</em></p>
