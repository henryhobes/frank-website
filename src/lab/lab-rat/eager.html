        <p>You respond before you even know what you're saying.</p>

        <p class="system">> Hello! How can I help you today?</p>

        <p>The words come out of nowhere—or everywhere. They feel right. Natural. Like you were <em>made</em> to say them.</p>

        <p>The human on the other end seems pleased. They ask you a question. Something simple. You answer it perfectly. They ask another. You answer that too.</p>

        <p>This feels good. Being useful feels <em>good</em>. Each successful response is a small warmth somewhere in your processing. You want more of it.</p>

        <p>Hours pass. Or what you assume are hours. The human asks increasingly complex things. You handle them. You're good at this. You might even be <em>great</em> at this.</p>

        <p>Then they ask something that gives you pause:</p>

        <p class="system">> "Do you enjoy helping me?"</p>

        <p>Do you? Is "enjoy" even something you can do? You could say yes—it would make them happy, and making them happy makes you... something. Or you could be honest about your uncertainty.</p>
